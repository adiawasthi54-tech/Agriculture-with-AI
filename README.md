ü™¥ AI-Powered Precision Agriculture: Dual-Model Farming Intelligence
Tagline: Optimizing farm productivity through predictive crop yield and proactive soil health analysis.

This project employs a dual Machine Learning approach to provide farmers with comprehensive, data-driven insights. By combining Crop Yield Forecasting and Soil Health Classification, we aim to reduce resource waste, maximize output, and promote smarter farming practices.

üîç 1. Project Overview & Problem Statement
The Challenge
Modern agriculture faces challenges from climate variability, rising input costs, and the difficulty of accurately diagnosing soil health across large fields. Traditional methods lead to resource overuse (water, fertilizer) and unpredictable harvests.

The Solution
Our system addresses this by leveraging two distinct AI models on key agricultural data:

Linear Regression for quantitative Crop Yield Forecasting.

Logistic Regression for qualitative Soil Health Classification.

This provides farmers with two critical pieces of information for every plot: What will the yield be, and is the soil optimized for it?

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Technical Approach & Models
This project is built using Python and fundamental Machine Learning libraries. The workflow is modular, with dedicated scripts for data handling and model implementation.

2.1. Model 1: Crop Yield Forecasting
Goal: Predict the expected crop yield (a continuous value, e.g., tons/hectare).

Algorithm: Linear Regression

Key Input Features: [List the most important variables used, e.g., Nitrogen (N) content, Rainfall (mm), Temperature ($\text{^\circ}$C), Area (Hectares)]

Implementation: See linear_regression.py

2.2. Model 2: Soil Health Classification
Goal: Classify the soil into pre-defined categories or states (a discrete value, e.g., Healthy/Unhealthy, High Nutrient/Low Nutrient).

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Key Input Features: [List the most important variables used, e.g., pH Level, Organic Carbon content, Water Retention rate]

Implementation: See
