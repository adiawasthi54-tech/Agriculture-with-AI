# 🪴 AI-Powered Precision Agriculture: Dual-Model Farming Intelligence
Tagline: Optimizing farm productivity through predictive crop yield and proactive soil health analysis.

## 🔍 1. Overview & Problem Statement
Modern agriculture faces significant hurdles: unpredictable harvests and the cost/environmental impact of unnecessary fertilizer and water use. Farmers often lack the clear, data-driven answers needed to optimize their fields.

This project introduces a dual Machine Learning framework to address this by providing two critical, distinct insights from the same core agricultural data:

Crop Yield Forecasting: Predicting how much to expect.

Soil Health Classification: Determining if the soil is ready to deliver.

## ⚙️ 2. Technical Approach & Models
The project utilizes a modular structure, clearly separating data processing from model implementation for maintainability and clarity.

2.1. Model 1: Crop Yield Forecasting
2.2. Model 2: Soil Health Classification
## 📈 3. Key Results and Performance Metrics
The models were validated using a standardized test set to ensure reliability.

Crop Yield Forecasting Performance (Linear Regression)
Soil Health Classification Performance (Logistic Regression)
## 💻 4. Repository Structure & Execution
The project's modular design makes the code easy to navigate and run.

## 🚀 5. Future Scope
Advanced Modeling: Implement ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) or deep learning to further reduce prediction error.

Web Interface: Develop a simple dashboard or mobile app to allow farmers to input their data and receive instant, actionable predictions.

Data Enrichment: Integrate satellite imagery data (NDVI) or real-time IoT sensor readings to enhance predictive power.
